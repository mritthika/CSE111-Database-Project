# CSE111-Database-Project

This is a project that acts as a library of movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as of December 2021. The SQL database of movies has
information such as the movie name, date of release, and the top three actors in the movie. When the code is run, a user can bookmark a movie
into their library via any of these categories to refer to. 

This project is a combination of SQL, Python, and C++ coding languages.
